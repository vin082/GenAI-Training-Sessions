    "## DO:\n",
    "1. ✅ **Always review AI output** - Don't copy-paste blindly\n",
    "2. ✅ **Provide rich context** - The 5 W's\n",
    "3. ✅ **Start with zero-shot** - Add examples if needed\n",
    "4. ✅ **Use low temperature for facts** - 0.0-0.2 for specs, compliance\n",
    "5. ✅ **Iterate on prompts** - Refine based on results\n",
    "6. ✅ **Save what works** - Build your prompt library\n",
    "7. ✅ **Verify technical accuracy** - You're the expert!\n",
    "\n",
    "## DON'T:\n",
    "1. ❌ **Don't trust blindly** - AI can hallucinate\n",
    "2. ❌ **Don't share confidential data** - Sanitize client info\n",
    "3. ❌ **Don't overpromise** - Validate feasibility\n",
    "4. ❌ **Don't forget your value** - AI assists, you differentiate\n",
    "5. ❌ **Don't skip human review** - Especially for compliance\n",

    "\n",
    "## Golden Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be Specific** - Vague prompts → vague results\n",
    "2. **Provide Context** - AI doesn't know your client\n",
    "3. **Show Examples** - One/few-shot for consistency\n",
    "4. **Set Boundaries** - Word count, tone, format\n",
    "5. **Iterate & Refine** - First draft rarely perfect\n",
    "6. **Always Verify** - You're accountable, not the AI"
